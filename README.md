# Trivia Game

Created and submitted during Week 5 of UT Austin's Houston Coding Bootcamp.  

In this assignment, the challenge was to create a timed trivia game. My game is Harry Potter themed. The player is allotted 30 seconds and has 4 answers to choose from. At the end of the game, a scoreboard displays their final score.
