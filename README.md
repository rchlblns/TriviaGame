Created and submitted during Week 5 of UT Austin's Houston Coding Bootcamp.  

In this assignment, the challenge was to create a timed trivia game. My game is Harry Potter themed. The player is allotted 30 seconds and has 4 answers to choose from. At the end of the game, a scoreboard displays their final score.

## Design Notes
* One question is shown at a time, until the user chooses an answer or time runs out
* Following questions are displayed without user input
* When the user presses the replay button, only the questions reload and not the whole page

## To-Dos
In future versions, I would like to add sound and tweak the visuals (fade in on game start, etc) as well as rewrite the code to be less repetative. Also need to find a way to tally up questions that were answered wrong and questions that were not answered sepearately.
